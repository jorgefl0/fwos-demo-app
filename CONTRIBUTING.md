There is a lot of complexity with emerging web3 and digital trust technologies and we recognize that we need collaborate with likeminded developers in order to keep up with the rapidly evolving standards and protocols. We welcome other contributors and maintainers to join the Farmworker Wallet OS project.

Low-code app platforms have gained a lot of popularity in recent years and adoption will only continue to grow. We are hopeful that this open source project under the umbrella of the OpenWallet Foundation will help attract other developers looking to make in impact with digital trust technologies with a significantly lower barrier to entry enabled by enterprise-grade low-code platforms like Mendix. Not-for-profit organizations, agencies, governments, and public service providers will be able to build privacy-preserving apps without braking the bank.
